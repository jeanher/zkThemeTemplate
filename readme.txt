Building prerequisites:
1. Required Node.js >= 10.16

Build Steps:

clone the zkThemeTemplate project

(initially)
init.sh
npm install

(build jar file)
mvn clean package
-> target/___THEME_NAME___.jar

or with compact profile

mvn clean package -P compact
-> target/___THEME_NAME___.jar

Development:

(compile run preview app)
mvn test exec:java@preview-app

of with compact profile

mvn test exec:java@preview-app -P compact

(open a simple preview page in the browser, add your own pages containing the components to preview)
http://localhost:8080

(continuous compile/watch less files - in a separate console)
npm run zklessc-dev

(update less-files with text editor, save file -> auto zkless compile -> browser will reload style sheet zk.wcs)



How to use ___THEME_NAME___.jar:

1. Put ___THEME_NAME___.jar in WEB-INF/lib, then ___THEME_NAME___ will become your default theme if there is no others theme.

2. Now you can also dynamically switch between different themes by cookie or library property
	* Use library-property
	  	<!-- in WEB-INF/zk.xml -->
		<library-property>
		    <name>org.zkoss.theme.preferred</name>
		    <value>___THEME_NAME___</value>
		</library-property>
		
	* Use cookie to switch theme, add a cookie
		zktheme=___THEME_NAME___
	
It does not require a server restart, but user has to refresh the browser.
